Modules used in python3: 

Boto3: It is the amazon web services (AWS) developing software kit (SDK) for python. This module allows python developers to write software that makes use of the amazon services. To install Boto3 we have to write in the terminal:
              $ pip install boto3 
Then, we have to set the credentials in an encrypted file: 
  example: 
             ~/.aws/credentials 
             
  Inside this file we will have: 
            [default]
            aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
            aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
            
After that we have to set the region in the same encrypted folder , but different file: 
  example: 
           ~/.aws/config
           
  Inside this file we will have: 
          [default]
          region=us-east-1
 
 In python it is important to import boto3 in our file:
          import boto3
          
In our program we used this library to receive taco orders and to send the corresponding response. 

Json: We used the Json library, Json is a way to structure data for it to be interpreted by any language. To use it the only hing we have to do is import it in our python file: 
      import json
 
Numpy: We used this library because it adds support for large multi-dimension arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functionsto operate on these arrays. To install this library we need to write the following: 
                  pip install "numpy-1.9.2rc1+mkl-cp34-none-win_amd64.whl"
                  
        Then, add in our python file "import numpy" to use it. 
        
Matplotlib: This library was used to plot, make graphs and tables. To install it we did: 
            Debian / Ubuntu : sudo apt-get install python-matplotlib
            Windows:  python -m pip install -U pip setuptools
                      python -m pip install matplotlib
             In our python files (where we did our graphs) we imported this library as: 
                      import matplotlib.pyplot

We also used other libraries that are already installed in python and only have to be imported to the files in hich they will be used like: 
      Threading
      Time 
      Queue
