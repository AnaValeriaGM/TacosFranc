### Tech

Tacos Franc used the following to work correctly:

* [PyQT] - Helps with the graphics in a user-friendly way


 Tacos Franc itself is open source with a [public repository][TacosFranc] on GitHub.

### Installation

Tacos Franc requires some extra libraries for it to run:  

[Boto3](https://github.com/boto/boto3) 

It is the amazon web services (AWS) developing software kit (SDK) for python. This module allows python developers to write software that makes use of the amazon services. To install Boto3 we have to write in the terminal:

```sh
  $ pip install boto3
```
Then, we have to set the credentials in an encrypted file:

```sh
      ~/.aws/credentials 
```
 Inside this file we will have:
 
```sh
     [default]
     aws_access_key_id = YOUR_KEY
     aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY         
```

After that we have to set the region in the same encrypted folder , but different file: 

```sh
      ~/.aws/config        
```
Inside this file we will have: 
```sh
      [default]
      region=us-east-1      
```
 In python it is important to import boto3 in our file:
 
```sh
      import boto3    
```       
          
In our program we used this library to receive taco orders and to send the corresponding response.


For production environments...

```sh
$ npm install --production
$ NODE_ENV=production node app
```

### Plugins

Dillinger is currently extended with the following plugins. Instructions on how to use them in your own application are linked below.

| Plugin | README |
| ------ | ------ |
| Dropbox | [plugins/dropbox/README.md] [PlDb] |
| Github | [plugins/github/README.md] [PlGh] |
| Google Drive | [plugins/googledrive/README.md] [PlGd] |
| OneDrive | [plugins/onedrive/README.md] [PlOd] |
| Medium | [plugins/medium/README.md] [PlMe] |
| Google Analytics | [plugins/googleanalytics/README.md] [PlGa] |


### Development

Want to contribute? Great!

Dillinger uses Gulp + Webpack for fast developing.
Make a change in your file and instantanously see your updates!

Open your favorite Terminal and run these commands.

First Tab:
```sh
$ node app
```

Second Tab:
```sh
$ gulp watch
```

(optional) Third:
```sh
$ karma test
```
#### Building for source
For production release:
```sh
$ gulp build --prod
```
Generating pre-built zip archives for distribution:
```sh
$ gulp build dist --prod
```
### Docker
Dillinger is very easy to install and deploy in a Docker container.

By default, the Docker will expose port 8080, so change this within the Dockerfile if necessary. When ready, simply use the Dockerfile to build the image.

```sh
cd dillinger
docker build -t joemccann/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```
This will create the dillinger image and pull in the necessary dependencies. Be sure to swap out `${package.json.version}` with the actual version of Dillinger.

Once done, run the Docker image and map the port to whatever you wish on your host. In this example, we simply map port 8000 of the host to port 8080 of the Docker (or whatever port was exposed in the Dockerfile):

```sh
docker run -d -p 8000:8080 --restart="always" <youruser>/dillinger:${package.json.version}
```

Verify the deployment by navigating to your server address in your preferred browser.

```sh
127.0.0.1:8000
```

#### Kubernetes + Google Cloud
